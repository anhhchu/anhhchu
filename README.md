<h1 align="center"> <img src="wave.gif" width="30px"> Hi, I'm Anh</h1>
<h3 align="center">Software Engineer @Microsoft | Data Lover | Lifelong Learner | Woman in Tech 👩🏻‍💻</h3>

Welcome to my GitHub Nest. I'm a Software Engineer who is passionate about working with data and bringing data insights closer to business users through the help of technology. I have experience in data engineering, big data, data science, back-end databases for web application. I’m currently working on ETL data pipeline using Big Data tools, Databases and Data warehouse on GCP and Azure. My tech stacks are Python, MSSQL, Linux, PySpark, Airflow, Tableau, BigQuery and Dataproc. 

👩🏻‍💻 Previous I worked on an analytics web application to help Walmart International Markets track end2end inventory level across different nodes in their massive supply chain. 

✨ When I grew up, girls were not encouraged to study engineering, science or technology. I had both of my bachelors and masters in Business, but later on realized that technology is where my career path should be. I'm a self-taught developer who enjoy the ongoing pursuit of knowledge even outside of the formal education system. I believe in life-long professional development, and that I can learn anything with hard work and dedication no matter how late I start

🌱 I’m learning Ruby on Rails, API and web development at the moment for my new job

⚡ Fun fact: LeetCode grinding is a daily hobby of mine. Better understanding of fundamental data structure and popular algorithms helps me write more efficient codes. *"One LeetCode problem a day keeps the worries away"*
